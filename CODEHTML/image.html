	<h2>What is dataStructure?</h2>
	<p>
		A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. While there are 			several basic and advanced structure types, any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose 			so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.

		In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it 			with various algorithms. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the 			data and functions that can be applied to the data.

		In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal 		operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that 		was not yet removed.

		In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the 			addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

	<h2>What is Linkedlist in data Structure?</h2>
	<p>
		<image src="linklist.png" style="float:left;padding-right:20px"></image>
		In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical 		placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of 		nodes which together represent a sequence
